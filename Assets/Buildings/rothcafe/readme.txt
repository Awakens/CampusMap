Hello professor,

For some reason, the texture does not appear on the cube faces while inside of edit mode (or any other mode for that matter)
In order to see the texture applied to the walls, you will need to render the image. It should show some brick style pattern
at an angle, to signify the slanted nature of the building.

Have a good one,
Ali Afzal
